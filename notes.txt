- same requests caching (local storage or any other solution)
- Promise.all or similar on js server to make the solution cleaner.
- UI (fancy slider + dynamic icons [clouds, rain, sunny, etc.])
- UX (better errors) [not through alerts]
- Make api more restful (instead of /data/get make /forecast GET, UPDATE, POST, DELETE )
- make production build for front end production + maybe some webpack optimizations are available like splitting in chunks?
- WCAG, Accessibility.
- if move to prod -> make server return the index.html that has all the refs for the build version of app logic.
- if app gets bigger, manage state through context OR redux.
- Add error boundaries for better UI error handling
